1. Representation of Data
2. Operation on Data

for eg: integer is stored as a single value in a bit
```
[sign][int][int][int][][][][][][][][][][][][]
1 bit          1  5  -  b  i  t  s 
```
int x; 
x is the data type
+ - * / % ++ -- are the operations on data 

## Abstract data type

List- collection of element
List -> 8, 3, 9, 4, 6, 10, 12
	0  1  2  3  4  5   6
	
	Data required for this list: 1. Space for storing element
				     2. Capacity of list
				     3. Size of the list
	
	This list can be represented by using: -
	
	1. Array
	2. Linked List
	
Operations that can be performed on the list: 
	1. add(x) / append(x)
		add(x) / append(ele) -Add element at end of the list
		add(index,ele) / insert(index,ele) - Add element at a given index
		remove(index)
		set(index, ele) / replace(index, ele) - changing element at given index
		get(indx) - knowing element at given index
		search(key)- search for an element's index if it is present in the list
		contains(key) - check if element is present in the list or not - used with search
		
		
		
	2. remove()
	3. search(key)
