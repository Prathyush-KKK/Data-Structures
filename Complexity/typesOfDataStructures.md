##Physical Data Structures: Used for storing data



1. Array- is used when length of list is known 
	has fixed size (static size) 
	can be created in stack as well as heap



2. Linked list- is used when want to add more elements dynamically (completely dynamic)
		variable length
		are always created in heap
		
		
		
## Logical Data Structures: Used to utilise and do work on Physical data structures

1. Stack  LIFO  -
			Linear data structures
2. Queues FIFO  -     

3. Trees      -
			Non-Linear data structures
4. Graph      -


5. Hash table  -       Tabular
