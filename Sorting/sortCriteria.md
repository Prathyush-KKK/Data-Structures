Different sorting algorithms:           {1,8}: comparision sort         {9, 11}: index based sort
1. Bubble                               {1,3}: O(n^2)     {4, 7}: nlO(nlogn)       {9, 11}: O(n)   {8}: O(n^3/2)
2. Insertion
3. Selection
4. Heap Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Quick Sort
7. Tree Sort
8. Shell Sort
9. Count Sort
10. Bucket/Bin Sort
11. Radix Sort


## How to determine which sorting technique to use
1. Number of comparisions (decides time complexity)
2. Number of swaps
3. Adaptive (if already sorted, then take minimum time)
4. Stable (if it preserves the order of duplicate elements in the sorted list)
5. Extra Memory
