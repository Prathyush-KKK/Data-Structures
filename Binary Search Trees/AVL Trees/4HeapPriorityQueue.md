## Binary Heap As Priority Queue
- Elements will have their piority and are inserted alongwith their priority
- While deleting, always the element with highest element is deleted
- Sometimes the number itself is the priority

eg: 4,9,5,10,6,20,8,15,2,18

### If larger element having higher priority:
use Insertion() and Delete() operation of Max Heap

### If smaller element having higher priority:
use Insertion() and Delete() operation of Min Heap
