## Insertion
```
                       [][30][]
         [][20][]                       [][40][]
[/][10][/]      [/][25][/]     [/][35][/]      [/][50][/]
```
1) Perform Binary Search: Find out if they key is already there or not.__
2) If key is not there: Find the position where it should be inserted.__
3) Create a new node: Create a tail pointer r.__
4) Whenever t is moved, r should move to the previous node (which t was pointing in)__
5) New node is inserted at the position where t is pointing to.__



eg: key = 38
1) Search: No 38 element, deserves to be on right child of data 35__
2) Move tailing pointer 'r' along with t while searching__
3) After finding the position, r will point to 35__ and t will point to null__
4) Creation of new node and linking it correctly should be done next__


## Algorithm

```cpp
void Insert(Node *t, int key){
    Node *r = NULL, *p;
    while(t!=NULL){
        r = t;
        if(key==t->data)
        return;
        else if(key<t->data)
            t = t->lchild;
        else
            t = t->rchild;
    }
    p = new Node;             //creating a new Node
    p->lchild = p->rchild = NULL;
    if(key<r->data)
        r->lchild = p;
    else
        r->rchild = p;
}

```
