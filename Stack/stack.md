## Stack
* Allows access to a single element at any given time
*Last in First Out (LIFO)
  eg: Dead end lane car parking, Shuttle cock storage and usage.
* ordered list
* inserting -> Pushing   Deleting -> Pop
* is an Abstract Data Type



## ADT- Abstract Data type
* A logical view of the data objects together with specifications of the operations required to create and manipulate them.
* defined in terms of its behavior rather than its implementation.
For a Stack:
Data: 1. Space for slicing elements
      2. top pointer

## Recursion vs Iteration
Recursion uses stack (system stack- automatic)
Iteration does not use stack.

## Applications of Stack
*Reversing Data
*Backtracking (like undo operation)
*Function calls (compilers use stack)
*Arithmetic expression evaluation (infix postfix)


Operations:
1. Push(x)
2. pop()
3. Peek(index)
4. StackTop()
5.isEmpty()
6. isfull()
