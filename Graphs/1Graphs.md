* No self loop and parallel edges- **SIMPLE GRAPH**
* No directed edges- **UNDIRECTED GRAPH**  (if no direction shown it points to both sides)
* Non-connected graph- Graph where all nodes are not connected to each other (there is a missing connection)
*  Biconnected Graph- if removal of one connection does not make the graph non-connected.
*  Strongly Connected Graph- if there is a path from every node to every other node. (from one vertex yoy can reach every other vertex).
