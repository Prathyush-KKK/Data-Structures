# Spanning Tree
* Spanning Tree is a subgraph of a graph having all vertices of a graph but n-1 edges. -> So that there is no cycle formed by those edges and graph must be connected.
* Normal Tree:
G = (V,E)
n = V       e = E
* Spanning Tree
S = (V', E')
V' = V     E' = V - 1
* Examples of spanning Tree:

* Number of ways to select spanning trees from a graph:
(E)C(v-1) - number of cycles getting formed

  ^ those 4 cycles must not be taken.


# Minimum cost spanning Tree.
* A spanning tree such that the cost of spanning tree (total weight of all edges) are the minimum.
